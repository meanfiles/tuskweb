TuskWeb is a lightweight browser project I started because I wasn’t satisfied with other browsers. They always felt either too heavy, too cluttered, or just didn’t work the way I wanted. Instead of endlessly searching, I decided to build my own.

It’s built with Electron, Node.js, and Chromium, which means it’s cross-platform and based on modern web technology. The interface and features are written in plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, keeping it simple and easy to extend.

The goal is to keep it minimal, customizable, and personal. A browser that works the way I want, and hopefully something others can enjoy too.
